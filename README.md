# Documentation

## Introduction

This repository documentation has the purpose of keeping track of the
work the representatives of the Faculty of Informatics pursue.

Since these projects and guidebooks evolve along time,
a repository highlights changelogs and progress.

It's important for the representatives work to be publicly available to
their leaders, i.e. the students, professors and academic staff.
